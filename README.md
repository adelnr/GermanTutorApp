# German-English Vocabulary Quiz App

This is a Flask-based web application designed to help users practice translating German words into English. The app loads vocabulary from an Excel file, quizzes the user with random words, and provides feedback on their answers.

## Features

- **Vocabulary Loading**: Loads German-English word pairs from an Excel file.
- **Random Quiz**: Asks the user to translate a randomly selected German word into English.
- **Voice Feedback**: Uses text-to-speech (gTTS) to provide audio feedback for correct and incorrect answers.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the user's score as they answer questions.
- **File Upload**: Allows users to upload their own Excel files with vocabulary.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backend logic is written in Python.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for handling HTTP requests and rendering templates.
- **gTTS**: Google Text-to-Speech for generating audio feedback.
- **Pandas**: For reading and processing Excel files.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For speech-to-text functionality (not fully implemented in this version).
- **PyGame**: For playing audio files.
